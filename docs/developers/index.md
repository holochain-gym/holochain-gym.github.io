# Developers ||2

Welcome to our gym!

We love that you decided to work on your holochain skills. 
This is the right place to train yourself to become a holochain developer.

In our gym you will find interactive *simulations*, working example *code* and hands-on *exercises*.
On the left, you have a list of exercises, ordered from easy to hard. 

**First stop: Concepts**

Work through the simulations in the [Concepts](/concepts) section, so you understand the main ideas underpinning every holochain app. 

**Next up: Requirements**

* Make sure your [setup](/developers/requirements/setup) is correct. 
* Take the [anatomy](/developers/requirements/anatomy) lesson to understand the file and folder structure of an exercise.
 
This will give you time to get used to the Rust syntax and see some [HDK](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#holochain-development-kit-hdk) functions in action.

**Finally**

You can hit the gym and start your [first exercise](/developers/basic/entries).

*Practice, rest, eat healthy and repeat.*  
*Good luck!*
